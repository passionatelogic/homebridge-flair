[Flair Smart Vent](https://flair.co/products/vent) plug-in for [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) using the Flair API.

## Requirements

- **Node.js**: v18.17.0, v20.9.0, or v22.0.0+
- **Homebridge**: v1.8.0+ or v2.0.0+


# Installation

<!-- 2. Clone (or pull) this repository from github into the same path Homebridge lives (usually `/usr/local/lib/node_modules`). Note: the code currently on GitHub is in beta, and is newer than the latest published version of this package on `npm` -->
1. Install homebridge using: `npm install -g homebridge`
2. Install this plug-in using: `npm install -g @sfenton/homebridge-flair`
3. Update your configuration file. See example `config.json` snippet below.

# Configuration

Configuration sample (edit `~/.homebridge/config.json`):

```json
{
    "platforms": [
        {
            "clientId": "client_id",
            "clientSecret": "client_secret",
            "pollInterval": 60,
            "platform": "Flair",
            "ventAccessoryType": "windowCovering"
        }
    ]
}
```

# Obtaining Credentials

In order to use this plugin you will need to obtain a client id and client secret from Flair. 
Most installs can rely on Flair's **client credentials** grant and only need the `clientId` and `clientSecret` values. Username/password support remains for legacy setups, but is no longer required.

### Advanced OAuth options

Optional properties are available if you need to override the default behaviour:

```json
{
    "platform": "Flair",
    "clientId": "client_id",
    "clientSecret": "client_secret",
    "grantType": "client_credentials",
    "realm": "Username-Password-Authentication",
    "tokenEndpoints": ["/oauth2/token", "/oauth/token"]
}
```

- `grantType` lets you force a specific OAuth flow. Omit it to attempt client credentials first and fall back automatically.
- `realm` only applies to the Auth0 password realm grant.
- `tokenEndpoints` overrides the default Flair endpoints order if your account uses a custom OAuth base URL.

Start by creating a Flair account at [my.flair.co](https://my.flair.co/) (if you haven't already), then use [this web form to request credentials](https://forms.gle/VohiQjWNv9CAP2ASA).

# Auto Vs Manual Mode

When you use Pucks with your setup the pucks will appear in the app as a Thermostat. 

~~If you turn those thermostats off it will put the Flair system into Manual mode. If you turn the thermostat to any other setting it will set your system to Flair's Auto mode.~~ As of Version 1.3.0 homekit does not do any switching from Auto to Manual mode. This must be done through the flair app, the Puck thermostats now respect the "off" setting.

# Vent Accessory Type

You can specify how vent accessories are shown in HomeKit with the `ventAccessoryType` property.

`windowCovering` - Window Covering
`fan` - Fan
`airPurifier` - Air Purifier
`hidden` - Hidden, this is useful if you have a puck in each room and want to only expose the room "thermostats"

### Releasing

A new version is released when a merge or push to `main` occurs.

We use the rules at [default-release-rules.js](https://github.com/semantic-release/commit-analyzer/blob/master/lib/default-release-rules.js) as our guide to when a series of commits should create a release.
